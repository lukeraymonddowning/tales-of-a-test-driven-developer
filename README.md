# Tales of a Test Driven Developer

This talk is all about how automated testing can drive your career forwards. 
I talk about my backstory, how I got into software engineering and how the pivotal moment in my career came the moment I decided to learn to write tests.

We also spend time debunking some common testing myths I hear all the time, then jump into the IDE to show off the testing experience in both Cypress
and Pest PHP.

Finally, I highlight some courses to help beginners on the road to testing.

All the slides are here for reference.

Kind Regards,
Luke
